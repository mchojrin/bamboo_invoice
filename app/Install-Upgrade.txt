How to new install
Go to phpMyAdmin and run the bambooinvoice.sql script to import the latest version of the bambooinvoice database
Copy the all the files to your webfolder e.g. /var/www/bambooinvoice

Rename the file in folder application/config

please DO NOT use your old files. Reconfigure the new files as decribed below.

application\config\config.sample.php to application\config\config.php
application\config\database.sample.php to application\config\database.php
application\config\email.sample.php to application\config\email.php

and configure the files with the appropriate settings for your runtime environment.

Login to your installation using
user:	admin@admin.com
pwd:	password

change the user and password to your own credentials and start configuring. If for some reason you cannot login. 
Change the admin@admin.com in the #_settings table entry and #_clientcontacts entry to your own email address and use 
the password reset functionality in bambooinvoice

How to upgrade BambooInvoice to from 0.8.9 to 1.0.0

First Backup MySQL and BambooInvoice files
Delete all files of the BambooInvoice installation
Copy new files into bambooinvoice folder

***** Important do not copy back the old files but change the values in the new files *****
Configure the variables in application\config\config.php
$config['base_url']	= 'http://localhost/bambooinvoice/'; to your old value in the previous installation
do the same for application\config\database.php
$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'root';
$db['default']['password'] = '';
$db['default']['database'] = 'bambooinvoice';
$db['default']['dbdriver'] = 'mysqli';
$db['default']['dbprefix'] = 'bamboo_';
$db['default']['active_r'] = TRUE;
$db['default']['pconnect'] = FALSE;
$db['default']['db_debug'] = TRUE;
$db['default']['cache_on'] = FALSE;
$db['default']['cachedir'] = '';
$db['default']['char_set'] = 'utf8';
$db['default']['dbcollat'] = 'utf8_general_ci';
same for application\config\email.php
$config['protocol'] = 'smtp';
$config['smtp_host'] = 'localhost';
$config['smtp_user'] = '';
$config['smtp_pass'] = '';
$config['smtp_port'] = '25';
same for application\config\config.php
// setting 'currency_decimal' will use this character instead of a '.' to separate
// the cents.  For example: $24.67 vs $24,67 vs $24_67... or whatever
$config['currency_decimal'] = '.';
// setting 'currency_thousands' will use this character instead of a ' to separate
// the thousand.  For example: $2'400.00 or $2,400.00 or whatever
$config['currency_thousands'] = '\'';


This is an important part of the Upgrade before calling any Upgrade Script. Because CodeIgniter has changed quite substantially we need to call this script manually via phpMyAdmin the rest is done via update Script

#### change the @ccy to your currency and only use the ISO codes https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html
Please use the database scripts to upgrade
#_ change this to your database table prefix usually bamboo_ and run the scripts in your bamboo database
SET @ccy = "USD";
ALTER TABLE `#_invoices` ADD COLUMN `currency_type`  VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE `#_invoices` ADD COLUMN `currency_symbol` VARCHAR(9) DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE `#_clients` ADD COLUMN `currency_type` VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE `#_clients` ADD COLUMN `currency_symbol` VARCHAR(9) DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE `#_clients` ADD COLUMN `invoice_note_default` VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE `#_clients` ADD COLUMN `days_payment_due` SMALLINT;
ALTER TABLE `#_settings` ADD COLUMN `currency_type_accounting` VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE `#_settings` ADD COLUMN `api_key` VARCHAR(200);
ALTER TABLE `#_settings` ADD COLUMN `exchange_surplus_middle_exchange_rate` decimal(20,6) DEFAULT '0.000000'
ALTER TABLE `#_sessions` MODIFY COLUMN `ip_address` VARCHAR(45);
ALTER TABLE `#_sessions` DROP COLUMN `user_agent`;
ALTER TABLE `#_sessions` MODIFY COLUMN `session_id` `id` VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE `#_sessions` MODIFY COLUMN `user_data` `data` BLOB NULL DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE `#_sessions` MODIFY COLUMN `last_activity` `timestamp` INT(10) UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT '0';
ALTER TABLE `#_invoices` ADD COLUMN `accounting_invoice_exchange_rate`  decimal(20,6) DEFAULT '0.000000';
UPDATE `#_invoices` SET `accounting_invoice_exchange_rate` = 1 WHERE `accounting_invoice_exchange_rate` = 0 OR `accounting_invoice_exchange_rate` = NULL;
UPDATE `#_invoices` SET `currency_type` = @ccy;
UPDATE `#_settings` SET `currency_type_accounting` = @ccy, `currency_type` = @ccy;
UPDATE `#_settings` SET `bambooinvoice_version` = "1.0.0";
This should take you to the Version 1.0.0

***** Important because CodeIgniter has changed on how to encrypt passwords your original password does not work anymore ****
Use the password reset functionality in bambooinvoice to set a new password

*********************************************************************************
Upgrade to version 1.0.1

This upgrade includes update to CodeIgniter 3.1.7 and PHP 7 compatibility and dompdf 0.8.1 from https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/

Remove usage of $config[‘standardize_newlines’]
The Input Library would optionally replace occurences of rn, r, n in input data with whatever the PHP_EOL value is on your system - if you’ve set $config['standardize_newlines'] to TRUE in your application/config/config.php.
This functionality is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.2.+.

Please use the database scripts to upgrade
Run these scripts against your bamboo invoice database 
#_ change this to your database table prefix usually bamboo_ and run the scripts in your bamboo database
UPDATE `#_settings` SET `bambooinvoice_version` = "1.0.1";

*********************************************************************************
Upgrade to version 1.0.2
changes:
dompdf 0.8.2
compatible with PHP 7.2 with OpenSSL enabled
mcrypt was removed from PHP 7.2 and therefore OpenSSL needs to be used to encrypt the passwords. As a consequence all passwords need to be reset either through the application by resetting the password in bamboo invoice

Database field password in clientcontacts had to be enlarged to 250

If by all means your password fails use password reset functionality 
or use the work around by Dave Miller

    Change line 60 in application/libraries/Site_sentry.php from if ($pwd == $password) { to if (TRUE) {
    Log in
    Go to settings and set a new password.
    Reverse the change in step 1.
    System now recognizes my new password.
